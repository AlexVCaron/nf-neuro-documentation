## How to contribute to the `nf-neuro` documentation.

To build the website locally, you need to install the `npm` package manager and `Node.js`. If you do not have it installed, follow the instructions on the official website: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm.

Once installed, git clone the `nf-neuro-documentation` repo and `cd` into it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/scilus/nf-neuro-documentation.git
cd nf-neuro-documentation/
```

Use `npm` to install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Then, to preview the changes on the website in real-time, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the `localhost` link that appeared in your terminal, it should open a browser with a preview of the website. Each time you save a file, the website will update according to your changes.
