### Build efficient neuroimaging pipelines

<b><i style="color:#24b064ff">nf-neuro</i></b> is an open-source initiative originally developed by the Sherbrooke Connectivity Imaging Lab (SCIL) 

Our mission is to provide researchers with scalable, reproducible, and efficient pipelines for neuroimaging applications.

### Why Choose nf-neuro?

<b><i style="color:#24b064ff">nf-neuro</i></b> contains **thoroughly tested and validated** modules to built
		efficient neuro-imaging pipeline ensuring **reproducible results**.

<b><i style="color:#24b064ff">nf-neuro</i></b> is built against the **`nf-core` guidelines**, which promotes
    high coding standards and good practice.

<b><i style="color:#24b064ff">nf-neuro</i></b>  regroups multiple modules using **state-of-the-art tools** from
    popular libraries (e.g., FSL, ANTs, scilpy, etc.).

Each components from <b><i style="color:#24b064ff">nf-neuro</i></b> have their **own container** (Docker or Singularity).
    Enabling an **easy use** on all architectures. 

### Get started

[Create Your Pipeline from A to Z](custom-pipeline/setup): Leverage our modules to build customized neuroimaging workflows.

[Contribute to nf-neuro](contribute/setup): Join our community and help advance the project.

[API Documentation](api/categories): Access detailed information on our modules and subworkflows and their functionalities.

Advanced tutorials: Go beyond and give superpowers to your pipeline ([Add BIDS input](bidsinput), setup [BIDS output](bidsoutput) or [automatic QC](advanced-tutorials/multiqc))

### Join the Community

 <b><i style="color:#24b064ff">nf-neuro</i></b> is an evolving project that thrives on contributions from the community. Whether you are a researcher, developer, or enthusiast, there are multiple ways to get involved:

<Steps>

1. Report issues or suggest new features.

2. Contribute code, documentation, or new modules.

3. Engage in discussions through forums and working groups such as [neurostars](http://neurostars.org/)

</Steps>

**By working together, we can push the boundaries of computational neuroscience and make powerful tools more accessible to all.**
