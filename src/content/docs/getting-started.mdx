## Getting Started

Welcome to the `nf-neuro` project ! A **Nextflow** modules and workflows repository for neuroimaging
maintained by the [SCIL team](https://scil-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The
primary focus of the library is to provide pre-built processes and processing sequences for
**neuroimaging**, optimized for _Nextflow DSL2_, based on open-source
technologies and made easily available to pipeline's developers through the `nf-core`
framework.

## WHY ? `nf-neuro`

**Let's say you develop a pipeline for neuroimaging**. You want to make it the more _efficient,_
_reliable, reproducible_ and also be able to _evaluate it_ and _control the quality_ of its outputs.
That's what `nf-neuro` provides to you, **all in one repository**, hosting **all dependencies** you
need to start developing and analyzing.

The only thing we ask of you is to develop in `Nextflow DSL2`. We use principle and standards
closely aligned with [nf-core](https://nf-co.re), but we'll make you adapt to them slowly as you go (we still
haven't finished complying to all of them ourselves). Using `nf-neuro` helps accelerate
development in **neuroimaging** and produces better research outcomes for all !

## Where do I start ?

Well, it depends on what you want to do. If you want to :

- **Learn about the modules and subworkflows** in `nf-neuro`, go to the [discovery](#discovering-nf-neuro) section.
- **Create a new pipeline quickly**, using **modules** and **subworkflows** from `nf-neuro`, go to the
  [prototyping](/guides/prototyping) section.
- **Create or publish a production pipeline** branded with `nf-neuro`, go to the
  [porting prototypes](/guides/production) section.
- **Contribute new modules and subworkflows** to `nf-neuro`, go to the
  [module](/guides/modules) or [subworkflow](/guides/subworkflows) contribution section.

## Discovering `nf-neuro`

To get information on `nf-neuro` components, you'll first need to install `python` and `nf-core`. We provide
extensive guidelines to do it in [this guide](/guides/basic_environment).

### Getting info on components from `nf-neuro`

With your environment ready, you can list `nf-neuro` modules available with a simple command :

```bash
nf-core modules list remote
```
<p>
  <figure align="center">
    <img src="/src/assets/images/cli/nfcore_modules_list.png" alt="nf-core modules list remote"/>
  </figure> 
</p>

The same goes for `subworkflows` :

```bash
nf-core subworkflows list remote
```

<p> 
  <figure align="center">
    <img src="/src/assets/images/cli/nfcore_subworkflows_list.png" alt="nf-core subworkflows list remote"/>
  </figure>
</p> 

To get more information on a module (say `denoising/nlmeans`) use :

```bash
nf-core modules info denoising/nlmeans
```

<p>
  <figure align="center">
    <img src="src/assets/images/cli/nfcore_modules_info.png" alt="nf-core modules info"/>
  </figure>
</p> 

or for a subworkflow (say `preproc_t1`) :

```bash
nf-core subworkflows info preproc_t1
```

<p>
  <figure align="center">
    <img src="src/assets/images/cli/nfcore_subworkflows_info.png" alt="nf-core subworkflows info"/>
  </figure>
</p> 

<Callout variant="info" title="Info">
  Additionally, `VS Code` users can install the [nextflow extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nextflow.nextflow),
  which contains a language server that helps you in real time when coding. It gives you useful tooltips on modules inputs and outputs, commands
  to navigate between modules and workflows and highlights errors. For sure, you get all that for free if you use the `devcontainer` !
</Callout>

<Callout variant="warning" title="Important">
  The `nextflow language server` is a precious resource that will help you resolve most exceptions existing within the metadata
  description of modules and workflows prescribed by `nf-core` and shown below. Thus, we highly recommend its use.
</Callout>

You'll get a good description of the modules's or subworkflow's `behavior` and `dependencies`, as well as a
thorough description of its `inputs` and `outputs`.

## Contributing to the `nf-neuro` project

<Callout variant="warning" title="Important">
  First, follow the [devops guide](/guides/setup_environment) to setup your
  `development environment` or check if your current one meets the requirements.
</Callout>

`nf-neuro` accepts contribution of new **modules** and **subworkflows** to its library. You'll need first to
[setup your environment](/guides/setup_environment), for which we have devised clever ways to streamline the procedure.
Then, depending on which kind of component you want to submit, you'll either need to follow the [module creation](/guides/modules)
or the [subworkflow creation](/guides/subworkflows) guidelines. Components that don't abide to them won't be accepted
and PR containing them will be closed automatically.

## Running tests

Tests are run through `nf-core`, using the command :

```bash
nf-core modules test <category/tool>
```

The tool can be omitted to run tests for all modules in a category.
