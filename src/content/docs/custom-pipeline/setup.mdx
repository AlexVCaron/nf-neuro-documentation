## Prototype pipeline development container

## Requirements

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) &geq; 1.95
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) &geq; 24 (we recommend using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop))

### Configure Docker access

The simplest way of installing everything Docker is to use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
You can also go the [engine way](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and install Docker manually.

Once installed, you need to configure some access rights to the Docker daemon. The easiest way to do this is to add your user
to the `docker` group. This can be done with the following command :

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

After running this command, you need to log out and log back in your terminal to apply the changes.

## Usage

First, create a `.devcontainer` directory at your project's root.
```bash
mkdir <project_dir>/.devcontainer
```

:::caution
The `prototyping` environment definition is not meant to be run from the `nf-neuro` repository root. If you downloaded or
cloned the `nf-neuro` repository, don't place your project at its root (we recommend putting your project outside its
directory to prevent conflicts with `git`).
:::

### Get the devcontainer configuration

If you downloaded or cloned `nf-neuro` locally :

- Copy the `prototyping` directory and its content, located in `<nf-neuro root>/.devcontainer`, to the `.devcontainer`
  directory in your project :
  ```bash
  cp -r <nf-neuro root>/.devcontainer/prototyping <project_dir>/.devcontainer/.
  ```

If you don't have nf-neuro locally, download the **prototyping devcontainer archive** at
[this link](https://github.com/scilus/nf-neuro/releases/download/latest/prototyping-devcontainer.zip) and extract it in
your project's `.devcontainer` directory.

### Launch your project in the devcontainer

To open your project in the devcontainer, using VSCode :
- Open your project with **VS CODE**
  - create a new window with **File > New Window** or `ctrl+shift+N`, then use **File > Open Folder** to open your `<project_dir>`.
- Click on the **box** in the lower left corner, to get a prompt to `Reopen in container`
  - alternatively, open the **command palette** with `ctrl+shit+P` and start typing `Reopen in ...` to filter in
    and select the command

The procedure will start a docker build, wait for a few minutes and enjoy your fully configured development environment.

## Available in the container

- `nf-core` accessible through the terminal, which is configured to access `nf-neuro` modules and subworkflows
- `git`, `github-cli`
- `curl`, `wget`, `apt-get`
- `nextflow`, `docker`, `tmux`

## Available in the VS Code IDE through extensions

- Docker images and containers management
- Nextflow execution environemnt
- Python and C++ linting, building and debugging tools
- Github Pull Requests management
- Github flavored markdown previewing
- Neuroimaging data viewer
- Test Data introspection
- Resource monitoring
- Remote development
- Live sharing with collaborators

## Manual installation

### Dependencies

- Python &geq; 3.8, < 3.13
- Docker &geq; 24 (we recommend using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop))
- Java Runtime &geq; 11, &leq; 17
  - On Ubuntu, install `openjdk-jre-<version>` packages
- Nextflow &geq; 23.04.0
- nf-test &geq; 0.9.0
- Node &geq; 14, `Prettier` and `editorconfig` (see [below](#installing-prettier-and-editorconfig))

:::caution
Nextflow might not detect the right `Java virtual machine` by default, more so if
multiple versions of the runtime are installed. If so, you need to set the environment
variable `JAVA_HOME` to target the right one.

- Linux : look in `/usr/lib/jvm` for
  a folder named `java-<version>-openjdk-<platform>` and use it as `JAVA_HOME`.
- MacOS : if the `Java jvm` is the preferential one, use `JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)`.
  Else, look into `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines` for the folder with the correct
  runtime version (named `jdk<inner version>_1<runtime version>.jdk`) and use the
  following : `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk<inner version>_1<runtime version>.jdk/Contents/Home`.
:::

### Python environment

The project uses _poetry_ to manage python dependencies. To install it using pipx,
run the following commands :

```bash
pip install pipx
pipx ensurepath
pipx install poetry==1.8.*
```

:::note
If the second command above fails, `pipx` cannot be found in the path. Prepend the
second command with `$(which python) -m` and rerun the whole block.
:::

:::caution
Poetry doesn't like when other python environments are activated around it. Make
sure to deactivate any before calling `poetry` commands.
:::

Once done, install the project with :

```bash
poetry install --no-root
```

### Loading the project's environment

:::caution
Make sure no python environment is activated before running commands !
:::

The project scripts and dependencies can be accessed using :

```bash
poetry shell
```

which will activate the project's python environment in the current shell.

:::note
You will know the poetry environment is activated by looking at your shell. The
input line should be prefixed by : `(nf-neuro-tools-py<version>)`, with `<version>`
being the actual Python version used in the environment.
:::

To exit the environment, simply enter the `exit` command in the shell.

:::caution
Do not use traditional deactivation (calling `deactivate`), since it does not relinquish
the environment gracefully, making it so you won't be able to reactivate it without
exiting the shell.
:::

### Global environment

Set the following environment variables in your `.bashrc` (or whatever is the equivalent for your shell) :

```bash
export NFCORE_MODULES_GIT_REMOTE=https://github.com/scilus/nf-neuro.git
export NFCORE_MODULES_GIT_BRANCH=main
export NFCORE_SUBWORKFLOWS_GIT_REMOTE=https://github.com/scilus/nf-neuro.git
export NFCORE_SUBWORKFLOWS_GIT_BRANCH=main
```

This will make it so the `nf-core` commands target the right repository by default. Else, you'll need to
add `--git-remote` and `--branch` options to pretty much all commands relating to `modules` and `subworkflows`.

### Working with VS Code

The `nf-neuro` project curates a bundle of useful extensions for Visual Studio Code, the `nf-neuro-extensions`
package. You can find it easily on the [extension marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nf-neuro.nf-neuro-extensionpack).

## Installing Prettier and editorconfig

To install **Prettier** and **editorconfig** for the project, you need to have `node` and `npm` installed on
your system to at least version 14. On Ubuntu, you can do it using snap :

```bash
sudo snap install node --classic
```

However, if you cannot install snap, or have another OS, refer to the [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
for the installation procedure.

Under the current configuration for the _Development Container_, for this project, we use the following procedure,
considering `${NODE_MAJOR}` is at least 14 for Prettier :

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_${NODE_MAJOR}.x | bash - &&\
apt-get install -y nodejs

npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier
npm install --save-dev --save-exact editorconfig-checker

echo "function prettier() { npm exec prettier $@; }" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "function editorconfig-checker() { npm exec editorconfig-checker $@; }" >> ~/.bashrc
```
