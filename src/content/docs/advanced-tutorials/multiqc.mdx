:::tip[What to expect from this walkthrough]
Once you complete this tutorial, you will be able to integrate
quality control reports into your own pipeline using the powerful
[MultiQC](https://docs.seqera.io/multiqc) tool! Users will then be able
to evaluate the results coming out from your work!
:::

Quality control in neuroimaging is an essential step to ensure good and
reproducible results, but it is often painful and requires a lot of manual
manipulation of final results. Pipelines developed within the [`nf-core`](https://nf-co.re/)
or `nf-neuro` ecosystem have access to a powerful tool to aggregate processing
results within interactive html reports: [MultiQC](https://docs.seqera.io/multiqc).
This integration allows for an easy evaluation of key processing steps for every
subjects and/or a more global evaluation (population-level) using quantitative
metrics. In this tutorial, you will see an overview of how MultiQC can integrate
your data into a clean report, and to implement it in your own pipeline.

## Prerequisites

<Steps>

1. Pipeline following the `nf-core` convention (similar to the one you
created in the [Your pipeline from A to Z](../pipeline/prototyping))

2. Access to the [`nf-core` tools command](https://nf-co.re/docs/nf-core-tools/)

</Steps>

## Installation

`nf-core` have already developed a dedicated module that runs MultiQC and create
the html report containing your data. However, we first need to install it
within your pipeline, to do so, run the following command:

<span slot="command">
```bash
nf-core modules --git-remote https://github.com/nf-core/modules.git -b master install multiqc
```
</span>
<span slot="output">
