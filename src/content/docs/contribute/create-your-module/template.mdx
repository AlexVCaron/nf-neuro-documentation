## Starting from the `nf-core` template

This page is the first of this tutorial series focusing on the creation of a custom
module meant for `nf-neuro`. By following the different pages, you will learn how to:
1. [Generate a new module using the `nf-core` template.](#generate-the-template)
1. [Edit the template.](/nf-neuro/contribute/create-your-module/main)
1. [Document your module.](/nf-neuro/contribute/create-your-module/documentation)
1. [Set up test cases for your module.](/nf-neuro/contribute/create-your-module/tests)

**We welcome all new modules relevant to neuro-imaging, regardless of the modality
it comes from!** Let's say, for the purpose of this tutorial, that you want to 
create a new module performing denoising on a T1w image using 
[`scil_denoising_nlmeans.py`](https://scilpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scripts/scil_denoising_nlmeans.html).

## First steps

Before starting, if not done already, clone the `nf-neuro` repository locally and
navigate to it :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scilus/nf-neuro.git
cd nf-neuro
```

Then, create a new branch for your module (in this tutorial, you'll re-develop the
`denoising/nlmeans` module, so name it `module/denoising_nlmeans) :

```bash
git checkout -b module/denoising_nlmeans
```

### Generate the template

Since `nf-neuro` is based on the [nf-core tools](https://nf-co.re/docs/nf-core-tools),
you have access to a command-line (CLI) script that will generate the skeleton,
using a template, of your module. First verify you are located at the root of 
the `nf-neuro` repository (not in `modules`), then run the following interactive command :

```bash
nf-core modules create
```

You will be prompted several times to configure the new module correctly. Refer
to the following to ensure configuration abides with `nf-neuro` :

- **Name of tool/subtool** : `category/tool` of the module you plan creating (e.g. denoising/nlmeans).
- **Bioconda package** : select `no`.
- **Github author** : use your Github handle, or `@scilus` if you prefer not being identified through `nf-neuro`.
- **Resource label** : select `process_single` if you required a single core. If your tool
  support multiprocessing, you can select `process_low` for 2 cores, `process_medium` for
  4 cores, and `process_high` for 6 cores. Please set this up responsibly. For `denoising/nlmeans`,
  we will select `process_medium`.
- **Meta map** : select `yes`.

Alternatively, you can use the following command to supply nearly all information :

```bash
nf-core modules create --author @scilus --label process_medium --meta denoising/nlmeans
```

You will still have to interact with the **bioconda** prompt, still select `no`.

:::note
  Once used to the conventions for developping within `nf-neuro`, adding `--empty-template`
  to the command will disable auto-generation of comments, examples and TODOs and
  can be a time-saver.
:::

The command will generate your new module template in the `./modules/nf-neuro/denoising/nlmeans`
directory. You now have all files required to properly set up your module! Now it is time to edit your `main.nf` file.
