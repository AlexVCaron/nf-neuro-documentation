## Prototype pipeline development container

## Requirements

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) &geq; 1.95
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) &geq; 24 (we recommend using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop))

### Configure Docker access

The simplest way of installing everything Docker is to use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
You can also go the [engine way](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and install Docker manually.

Once installed, you need to configure some access rights to the Docker daemon. The easiest way to do this is to add your user
to the `docker` group. This can be done with the following command :

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

After running this command, you need to log out and log back in your terminal to apply the changes.

## Usage

First, create a `.devcontainer` directory at your project's root.
```bash
mkdir <project_dir>/.devcontainer
```

<Callout variant="warning" title="Important">
The `prototyping` environment definition is not meant to be run from the `nf-neuro` repository root. If you downloaded or
cloned the `nf-neuro` repository, don't place your project at its root (we recommend putting your project outside its
directory to prevent conflicts with `git`).
</Callout>

### Get the devcontainer configuration

If you downloaded or cloned `nf-neuro` locally :

- Copy the `prototyping` directory and its content, located in `<nf-neuro root>/.devcontainer`, to the `.devcontainer`
  directory in your project :
  ```bash
  cp -r <nf-neuro root>/.devcontainer/prototyping <project_dir>/.devcontainer/.
  ```

If you don't have nf-neuro locally, download the **prototyping devcontainer archive** at
[this link](https://github.com/scilus/nf-neuro/releases/download/latest/prototyping-devcontainer.zip) and extract it in
your project's `.devcontainer` directory.

### Launch your project in the devcontainer

To open your project in the devcontainer, using VSCode :
- Open your project with **VS CODE**
  - create a new window with **File > New Window** or `ctrl+shift+N`, then use **File > Open Folder** to open your `<project_dir>`.
- Click on the **box** <Icon name="arcticons:microsoft-remotedesktop" class="text-sky-700 text-xl text-bold inline-block" /> in the lower left corner, to get a prompt to `Reopen in container`
  - alternatively, open the **command palette** with `ctrl+shit+P` and start typing `Reopen in ...` to filter in
    and select the command

The procedure will start a docker build, wait for a few minutes and enjoy your fully configured development environment.

## Available in the container
