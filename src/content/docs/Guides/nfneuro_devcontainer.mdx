## Using `nf-neuro` development containers

`nf-neuro` comes preloaded with a set of development containers destined at streamlining
your development. They provide `pre-installed` environments for you to start programming
new `pipelines` or `nf-neuro components`.

## Requirements

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) &geq; 1.95
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) &geq; 24 (we recommend using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop))

### Configuring Docker for easy usage

The simplest way of installing everything Docker is to use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). You can also go the [engine way](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and install Docker manually.

Once installed, you need to configure some access rights to the Docker daemon. The easiest way to do this is to add your user to the `docker` group. This can be done with the following command :

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

After running this command, you need to log out and log back in to apply the changes.

## Prototyping environment

<Callout variant="warning" title="Warning">
The `prototyping` environment definition is not meant to be run from the `nf-neuro` repository root.
Locate your project elsewhere (we recommend putting it outside this directory to prevent
conflicts with `git`).
</Callout>

### Usage

Copy the **devcontainer** definition located in `.devcontainer/prototyping` inside a `.devcontainer`
directory inside your project. Then, open your project with **VS CODE** and click on the **blue box** in the
lower left corner, to get a prompt to `Reopen in container`. The procedure will start a docker build, wait
for a few minutes and enjoy your fully configured development environment.

#### Available in the container

- `nf-core` accessible through the terminal, which is configured to access `nf-neuro` modules and subworkflows
- `git`, `github-cli`
- `curl`, `wget`, `apt-get`
- `nextflow`, `docker`, `tmux`

#### Available in the VS Code IDE through extensions

- Docker images and containers management
- Nextflow execution environemnt
- Python and C++ linting, building and debugging tools
- Github Pull Requests management
- Github flavored markdown previewing
- Neuroimaging data viewer
- Test Data introspection
- Resource monitoring
- Remote development
- Live sharing with collaborators

## Production environment

SECTION TO COME

## Development environment

### Usage

To use the development environment, you need to have the repository cloned. You can do it using
_VS Code_. Once opened in _VS CODE_, click on the arrow box in the lower left corner, to get a prompt to
`Reopen in container`. Select the `devops` container. The procedure will start a docker build, wait for a
few minutes and enjoy your fully configured development environment.

#### Available in the container

- `nf-neuro`, `nf-core` all accessible through the terminal, which is configured to load
  the `poetry` environment in shells automatically
- `nf-neuro` configured as the main repository for all `nf-core` commands, using `NFCORE_-` environment variables
- `git`, `github-cli`
- `curl`, `wget`, `apt-get`
- `nextflow`, `nf-test`, `docker`, `tmux`

#### Available in the VS Code IDE through extensions

- Docker images and containers management
- Nextflow execution environemnt
- Python and C++ linting, building and debugging tools
- Github Pull Requests management
- Github flavored markdown previewing
- Neuroimaging data viewer
- Test Data introspection
- Resource monitoring
- Remote development
- Live sharing with collaborators
