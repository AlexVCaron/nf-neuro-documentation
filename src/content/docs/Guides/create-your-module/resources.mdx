## Request for more test resources

Test runners are tailored to restrain their resources usage to specifically what is asked for by
Nextflow through the configuration files. For `nf-neuro` tests, you can find this configuration in
`tests/config/nextflow.config`. If any of your tests ask for more, you need to define it correctly.

<Callout variant="info" title="Info">
The container detects out-of-bound resource consumption automatically, tests will fail if they
haven't been assigned them sufficiently. It's a good way to catch them.
</Callout>

First, resource requirements need to be defined in the `nextflow.config` file(s) of your test
cases. Add the `process.cpu` and `process.memory` and set their requirements as needed :

```
process.memory = '9G'
process.cpus = 6
```

or

```
process {
  memory = '10G'
  cpus = 6
}
```

To allow test runners on your PR to run with sufficient resources, you'll need to specify to which
class of runners to assign to. To do so, edit `.github/workflows/run_checks_suite.yml`. Find the
`matrix` definition for the `nf-test` job (currently around `line 133`) and add the following
request for a runner in the `include` section :

```
- runner: <name-of-the-runner-class>
  path: modules/nf-neuro/<category>/<tool>
```

Available runner classes that superseed `default` :

| Runner Class                   | Resources                               |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| (default)                      | <ul><li>4 CPU</li><li>4Gb RAM</li></ul> |
| scilus-nf-neuro-bigmem-runners | <ul><li>16Gb RAM</li></ul>              |

<Callout variant="warning" title="Important">
Specialized runners are limited !!! They are allocated for hungry processes, such as **AI/ML** models and **large dataset studies**, don't abuse them. _The more they are requested for, the longer PR take to merge_, so don't ask for them for nothing, meaning be smart in designing your modules ! **PRs deemed not needing them will be automatically closed.**
